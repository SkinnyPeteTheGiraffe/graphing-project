# Algorithms 4ᵗʰ, Edition Adaptation

This repository contains a adaptation of the code provided for *Algorithms 4ᵗʰ, Edition* written by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.
The original code, as well as the step by step guide can be found at: http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/

This adaptation focuses mainly on the graphing portion of the book. It also emphasizes on maintaining a clean easy to
read OOP structure by highly documenting classes and methods, removing the need for null values, encapsulating fields, 
and also taking advantage of the features provided by Java 8.
